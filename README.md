## Install the "clean" Trongate module

1. Copy the `clean` folder into your `modules` folder of your Trongate project.

2. Copy the `clean.php` into your `templates\views` folder of your Trongate project.

3. Add this method to your `templates/controllers/Templates.php` file:

```php
    function clean($data) {
        load('clean', $data);
    }
```

4. The Clean CSS demo with useful components will be accessible at: `http://localhost/your_project/clean/index`

5. Copy the `Makefile`, the `package.json`, and the `package-lock.json` files to the root of your project.

6. Add `node_modules` to `.gitignore`.
